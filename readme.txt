This is a project that allows you to control iTunes on your computer from any device by sending HTTP GET requests to the server running on your computer.

Requires appscript for python 3 on OS X.
appscript is a set of AppleScript bindings for python. For more information: http://appscript.sourceforge.net/

Since this project depends on AppleScript, it is only usable on OS X.

Currently, the following query parameters are accepted. There is only one endpoint: /.
1. auth=[string] - the 6 character auth key generated by the server.
2. playlists - a request for all the available playlists
3. play=[string] - plays the given playlist. Playlist must be in the list returned by querying playlists
4. pause - pauses iTunes.

To run, execute `python3 iTunesServer.py`.
